I'm Sadra Sefidgari and this is a portfolio in case you didn't figure it out yet.

I'm a software developer (kind of) and I've been coding for quite some time now

I coded in C# , Java , Dart , Dom JS , Node JS, Python and a little bit of C and C++.

My interests in computer field are Network and Security.

I'm also obsessed with gaming and chess!
